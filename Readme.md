# .NET Accelerator for Azure Cloud Design Patterns

Welcome to the .NET Accelerator for Azure Cloud Design Patterns repository. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and toolkit for implementing various Azure Cloud Design Patterns using .NET, Terraform, and Azure DevOps (ADO) pipelines. Each design pattern is encapsulated within its dedicated folder, containing the .NET code, Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts, and ADO pipeline configurations necessary for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- .NET Core SDK (version specified in global.json)
- Terraform
- Azure CLI
- An Azure subscription

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sowens81/Azure-Application-Design-Pattern-DotNet-Accelerator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific design pattern folder you're interested in:

   ```bash
   cd Azure-Application-Design-Pattern-DotNet-Accelerator/CloudDesignPatterns/<design-pattern-name>
   ```

3. Follow the README.md file in the design pattern's folder for detailed setup and deployment instructions.

## Design Patterns

This repository covers a range of Azure Cloud Design Patterns, each located in its respective folder. Here's a list of the design patterns currently implemented:

- [**CQRS**](/CloudDesignPatterns/CQRS/Readme.md): 
The Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern in Azure separates read and write operations into distinct interfaces, improving scalability and performance by allowing more efficient read and write data models, and enabling the independent scaling of the read and write workloads. Unique features include the ability to handle high-performance applications by segregating the data modification and data query responsibilities, which can lead to optimized data storage, retrieval, and scalability in cloud environments.
- [**FederatedIdentity**](/CloudDesignPatterns/FederatedIdentity/Readme.md: The Federated Identity pattern in Azure Cloud leverages a centralized identity provider to manage user authentication and authorization across multiple applications and services, offering unique features such as single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, streamlined identity management across different systems, and enhanced security by centralizing user credentials and access policies.
- **TBD**: TBD

For more detailed information, refer to the README.md file within each design pattern's folder.
